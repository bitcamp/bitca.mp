The website hosted at http://2014.bit.camp/.

## Run it on your machine

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone it to your machine
3. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
4. Start her up in development mode:
   `npm run dev`
5. Head to http://localhost:8000/

## Produce a production build:

1. `npm run build`
2. serve the `./docs` folder somehow!

### P.S.

You'll have to setup and run the backend,
[ember](https://github.com/bitcamp/ember), seperately. Either use nginx or
apache (or something) serve both of these projects in development mode, or run
the `grunt` command to produce a fully compiled frontend in the ./public
folder, and make `ember` serve that.

## Code with us

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone it and make make a new branch.
3. Write some code, commit, and push.
4. Probably do step #3 a few more times.
5. Send a Pull Request.
